# ERCOT LMP Analytics

**Stack:** Snowflake · dbt Cloud · Power BI

This repository hosts a learning/portfolio project to model and analyze ERCOT Locational Marginal Prices (LMP) — Day-Ahead vs Real-Time — across nodes/zones and time.

## Goals (Q4 2025)
- Stand up Snowflake + dbt Cloud (via Partner Connect) with Git connected.
- Build a minimal dbt project: `staging` + `core` with tests and docs.
- Connect Power BI to Snowflake and publish a v1 dashboard.
- Publish a clear, narrative README and artifacts for the portfolio.
